[Doctor]: Good morning, Mrs. Johnson. How are you feeling today?

[Patient]: Good morning, Doctor. Well, I've been having some issues lately. I've been experiencing persistent headaches for about two weeks now, mostly in the front of my head and behind my eyes.

[Doctor]: I see. Can you describe the headaches? Are they throbbing, or more of a constant pressure?

[Patient]: It's more like a constant pressure, and sometimes it gets worse when I'm stressed or haven't slept well. I've also been feeling more tired than usual.

[Doctor]: How would you rate the pain on a scale of 1 to 10?

[Patient]: Usually around a 5 or 6, but sometimes it spikes to an 8, especially in the evening.

[Doctor]: Have you noticed any other symptoms? Nausea, vision changes, sensitivity to light?

[Patient]: Yes, actually. I've had some blurry vision occasionally, and bright lights seem to bother me more than they used to. No nausea though.

[Doctor]: Are you currently taking any medications?

[Patient]: I take Lisinopril 10 milligrams daily for my blood pressure, and I've been taking ibuprofen 400 milligrams as needed for the headaches, maybe three or four times a week.

[Doctor]: Have you been checking your blood pressure at home?

[Patient]: Yes, it's been running a bit higher lately, around 145 over 95. It's usually better controlled than that.

[Doctor]: I'd like to check your blood pressure now and do a quick neurological exam. Based on what you're describing, this could be tension headaches, but given your history of hypertension and the visual symptoms, we should rule out any secondary causes.

[Patient]: That sounds good. I've also been under a lot of stress at work lately, and I know that probably isn't helping.

[Doctor]: Stress can definitely contribute to both headaches and elevated blood pressure. Let me check your vitals. Your blood pressure is reading 148 over 92 today. I'd like to order some blood work including a complete metabolic panel to check your kidney function, and I think we should schedule an eye exam as well.

[Patient]: Do you think the ibuprofen could be causing any problems? I read something about that online.

[Doctor]: That's a good question. Frequent use of NSAIDs like ibuprofen can actually contribute to rebound headaches and may also affect blood pressure in some patients. I'd recommend switching to acetaminophen 500 milligrams for now, and limiting it to no more than twice a week if possible.

[Doctor]: I'm also going to increase your Lisinopril to 20 milligrams daily to help get your blood pressure back under better control. We should see improvement within a week or two.

[Patient]: Okay, I can do that. Should I be worried about anything serious?

[Doctor]: Based on my examination today, your neurological signs are normal, which is reassuring. However, I do want to see you back in two weeks to recheck your blood pressure and see how the headaches are responding. If the headaches suddenly worsen, or you develop any new symptoms like weakness, numbness, or severe visual changes, please call us right away or go to the emergency room.

[Patient]: Thank you, Doctor. I'll make sure to follow up.

[Doctor]: You're welcome. Let's also discuss some lifestyle modifications - reducing sodium intake, regular exercise, and stress management techniques can all help with both the headaches and your blood pressure. I'll have our nurse provide you with some educational materials.

[Patient]: That would be helpful. I've been meaning to get back to the gym but haven't made time for it.

[Doctor]: Even 30 minutes of walking five days a week can make a significant difference. Start small and build up gradually. Any questions before we wrap up?

[Patient]: No, I think that covers everything. Thank you for taking the time to explain all of this.

[Doctor]: Of course. Take care, and we'll see you in two weeks.
